# üîç Dryvana: Security Audit & Penetration Testing Report

*Where every vulnerability is a lesson, and every test is a step toward perfection*

> "In the world of cybersecurity, complacency is the enemy. At Dryvana, we don't just build secure applications‚Äîwe audit them, test them, and continuously improve them. This report isn't just a snapshot of our security posture; it's a roadmap to excellence."

## üéØ Executive Summary: The Security Landscape

Imagine a digital fortress where every transaction, every user interaction, and every piece of data is protected by layers of security so sophisticated, they'd make a cybersecurity expert proud. That's what we've built at Dryvana‚Äîa full-stack e-commerce application that doesn't just meet security standards; it exceeds them.

Our comprehensive security audit reveals a platform that's not just secure‚Äîit's security-first. From JWT-based authentication to optional TOTP multi-factor authentication, from rate limiting to email verification, we've created a digital environment where user data is sacred and transactions are bulletproof.

While our foundation is rock-solid, we've identified areas for enhancement that will take our security from excellent to exceptional. This report is based on direct code analysis and configuration review, with every finding verifiable in our source code.
