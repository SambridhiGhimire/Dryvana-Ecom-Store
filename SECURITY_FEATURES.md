*Where every feature is a guardian, and every line of code is a protector*

> "In the digital marketplace, trust is the most valuable currency. At Dryvana, we've built more than an e-commerce platform‚Äîwe've created a digital sanctuary where security isn't just a feature; it's the foundation upon which everything else is built."

## üéØ Overview: The Security-First Philosophy

Dryvana isn't just another e-commerce platform‚Äîit's a testament to what happens when security is treated as a first-class citizen. Our full-stack application implements robust authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms that would make a cybersecurity expert proud.

From JWT-based authentication to optional TOTP multi-factor authentication, from rate limiting to email verification, we've woven security into the very fabric of our platform. Passwords are securely hashed, user management includes RBAC and account blocking, and every transaction is protected by multiple layers of security.

This document details every security feature as implemented in our codebase‚Äîno speculation, no theoretical features, just the real, working security that protects our users every day.
